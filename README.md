# CGM Performance Assessment
A collection of software packages for the statistical performance assessment of continous glucose monitoring systems. The software is provided by the [**Institut für Diabetes-Technologie, Forschungs- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH an der Universität Ulm**](https://www.idt-ulm.de/en/) with support form the [**Diabetes Center Berne**](https://www.dcberne.com). The software is distributed under an [MIT license](LICENSE) and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

Currently, the following software tools in *Python* and *R* (some of them) are available:
### Calculation of confidence intervals on agreement rates for the assessment of compliance with FDA iCGM criteria

### Continuous Glucose Deviation and Interval Analysis (CG-DIVA)
