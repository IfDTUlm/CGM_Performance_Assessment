## Python and R

### Installation

All functions are contained in one script that simply needs to be included.

Required packages for Python:

* pandas
* numpy
* scipy

Required packages for R:

* data.table
* dplyr
* tidyr
* purrr
* rsample
* GenBinomApps

### Usage

In both implementations, the main function *CI_calculation* is called identically and calculates the lower, one-sided 95% confidence intervals on the agreement rates as stipulated by the FDA using the Clopper-Pearson, clustered continuity-corrected Wilson and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap methods. 

```
CI_calculation(df,save_path,filename="CI_results",
                N_BS=10000,seed=1):
```
**Parameters:**

**df:** Pandas DataFrame (Python) or Data.Frame (R) with columns *SensorID*, *Comp* and *CGM*. *SensorID* must contain a unique identifier (string or number) for each CGM sensor. *Comp* must contain the  comparator measurement in mg/dL. *CGM* must contain the results of paired CGM measurements in mg/dL. Empty cells are not permitted

**save_path**: Path for saving results table

**filename** *(optional)*: Filename of the output files *(default: CI_results)*

**N_BS** *(optional)*: Number of bootstrap samples for calculating the bootstrapped confidence intervals. For a reliable estimation of we recommend to use at least 10 000 bootstrap samples. However for testing purposes the sample size can be reduced to reduce computation time. *(default 10 000)*

**seed** *(optional)*: Seed for the random number generator used in the bootstrapping process. Provide [] (Python) or NA (R) if a the seed shall be automatically generated. Caution: Automatic seed generation can lead to slightly different results with each function call. To ensure reproducability provide a fixed seed *(default 1)*

**Returns**:

A csv table with agreement rates (+/- 15 mg/dl or % (AR15), +/- 20 % (AR20), +/- 40 mg/dl or % (AR40)) in each glucose range (<70, 70-180, <180 and total) and their lower, one-sided 95% confidence intervals as calculated by the three approaches Clopper-Pearson (CP), clustered continuity-corrected Wilson (WCC) and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrapping (BCa).


An example of how to use the function and their output is provided in the files *Example.py*/*Example.R*.
